# SQL Joins – Customer & Orders Analysis 📊

## 📌 About the Project  
This project demonstrates SQL JOIN operations on **Customer** and **Orders** tables to analyze order history.  

## 📁 Files Included  
✅ `customers_table.sql` – SQL script for creating the **Customer** table.  
✅ `orders_table.sql` – SQL script for creating the **Orders** table.  
✅ `joins_queries.sql` – SQL queries for **INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN**.  
✅ `results_screenshot.png` – Screenshot of query results.  

## 🔍 SQL Joins Performed  
📌 **INNER JOIN** – Fetches customers who have placed orders.  
📌 **LEFT JOIN** – Fetches all customers, even those without orders.  
📌 **RIGHT JOIN** – Fetches all orders, even if no customer details exist.  
📌 **FULL JOIN** – Fetches all customers & orders, even if they don’t match.  

## 🚀 How to Run  
1️⃣ Import the `customers_table.sql` and `orders_table.sql` into your SQL database.  
2️⃣ Run the queries from `joins_queries.sql` to see JOIN operations in action.
